In the fall of 2023, Connor Jacob Ko transitioned into the XYZ School District. At nine years old, Connor's journey through education had already been marked by a history of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and therapeutic goals. His story is one of challenges and perseverance, both for Connor and his dedicated parents.

Connor was born on November 13, 2013, and from an early age, he faced difficulties that required special attention in his academics and communication skills. Back in 2020, as reported in the ESY Progress Report, Connor participated in the Extended School Year program. His goals focused on foundational skills: using concrete objects for math, recognizing sight words, and improving his speech and language capabilities. Despite the constraints of distance learning during that period, Connor showed noteworthy progress, particularly thriving in an adult-supported environment. He achieved impressive accuracy in math tasks and made strides in reading, though his speech and language sessions were limited due to external factors. Christina Derebenskaya, his speech-language pathologist, noted his attentiveness and progress as encouraging signs of his potential.

Fast forward to 2022, as outlined in the Goal Progress Report, Connor's needs evolved. He was working towards both motor skills and more complex cognitive tasks. His IEP targeted various areas: improving handwriting and scissor skills, enhancing functional communication, and developing number sense and addition and subtraction skills. Though he showed variable progress—sometimes struggling with tasks like counting by twos and following two-step directions without prompts—Connor's persistence and incremental improvements were clear.

However, challenges persisted. By the time Connor entered the XYZ School District in 2023, his parents recognized the need for a comprehensive evaluation of his educational requirements. By October, they had requested an evaluation for special education services. The school's assessment in November identified Connor as eligible for an IEP—a decision that acknowledged his unique educational needs.

The IEP meeting held in January 2024 reflected concerns about the sufficiency of the proposed services. Connor’s parents, familiar with his history and previous progress reports, disagreed with the school's recommendations, advocating for services that they believed would better support his growth.

In February, seeking a more tailored evaluation, the parents requested an independent educational evaluation (IEE). Their request was subsequently denied by the school on March 1, 2024, indicating a point of contention and heightening their resolve to ensure that Connor received an education that matched his potential and previous progress.

The culmination of these events led to the filing of a due process complaint by Connor's parents by April 2024. This legal step was a testament to their unwavering commitment to securing an appropriate education for their son—one that acknowledged his past achievements and addressed his current challenges.

Connor's story is not just about his personal growth but also about the advocacy and dedication of his parents, who tirelessly sought the best path forward in an often complex educational landscape. Though the journey was fraught with obstacles, it underscored the profound impact of perseverance, both from the student and those who believed in him.
